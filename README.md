My PGP keys
===========

There are 2 PGP keys I use for signing commits and other purposes.

They are 0x7c5f87b6c87001ea and 0xA3A95346E6A39610

The can be obtained by 

1. Cloning this repository

or

2. Searching either of these key servers with your browser:

https://pgpkeys.eu

https://keys.openpgp.org/

or

3. Fetching the keys with your gpg program using the --keyserver option.

Example:

`gpg --keyserver hkps://pgpkeys.eu --recv-keys 0x7c5f87b6c87001ea`

`gpg --keyserver hkps://pgpkeys.eu --recv-keys 0xA3A95346E6A39610`
